# Overview

This is a simple and interactive Countdown Timer application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks). It allows users to set a custom countdown time (in seconds, minutes, or a specific date/time), and the timer updates live every second until it reaches zero. The project demonstrates key JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, setInterval(), event handling, and basic date/time calculations. Itâ€™s ideal for beginners learning how to build dynamic and time-based features using vanilla JavaScript.
